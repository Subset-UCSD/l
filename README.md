# links
redirection "database"

all shortlinks should follow this format
```md
---
layout: forward
target: https://github.com/Subset-UCSD/Commit-Challenge-2025
---
```
where the target is the link you want to redirect to and the name of the markdown file is the shortlink.

for example, if the file above was called `gh.md`, then `subset-ucsd.github.io/l/gh` would redirect to `https://github.com/Subset-UCSD/Commit-Challenge-2025`

## auto merging links
the yml probably doesn't work yet
